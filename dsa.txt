DS is a logical way to store and oraganize data so that it can be used efficiently.

2 types of DS :
1. Linear DS
        DS where data items are organised sequentially and they are attached one after 
        another. Eg. Array, Linked List, stack, queue.

        Array: Collection of data types of similar type.
        element 35 33 45 42 10 16 28
        index   0  1  2  3  4  5  6
        size = 7

        Stack: LIFO(last in first out) Ds where data last added(push)
        is removed first(pop).

        Queue: FIFO(first in first out) DS where data first added(enq)
        is removed first(deq).
        (back/rear end and front end)

        Linked List: collection of nodes where each node made up of data
        element and a reference to next node in sequence. 
        
        

2. Non Linear DS
        DS where data items are not organised sequentially.Here all data items 
        can't be traversed in single run. Eg. Tree, Graph. 

        Tree: A Tree is data structure that is made up of a set of linked nodes.
        It emulates a hierarchical tree structure and form a parent child relationship.

        Graph: It is collection of finite number of vertices and edges that connect the
        vertices. Edges represents relationship among vertices that stores data elements.
