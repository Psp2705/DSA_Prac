# binary seacrch

# imagine no form 1 to 100 if one say 50 we tell them it is less than it
# then we take 25 and ask if it is less than or greater than 50
# if it is less than we take 12 and ask if it is less than or greater than 25
# if it is less than we take 6 and ask if it is less than or greater than 12
# everytime we halve the search space   and divide the search space by 2
# O(log n) time complexity
